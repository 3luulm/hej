 &emsp;As the cost of living is extremely high in Copenhagen, two poor little Asians came up with the idea of volunteering for free vintage clothing (2 geniuses)<p>
 &emsp;The venue for the event was right next to Superkilen - a huge park (really wish we could teleport right back there now)<br>
 &emsp;It was a sunny day and everything seems nice, but little did they know <br>
 &emsp;~the workload was much heavier than they expected~ <br>
 &emsp;p.s. especially for the guy, the girl was slacking off all the time because she is too short to be seen σ`∀´)σ <p>
 &emsp;The girl was having free pizza & wine, chilling aside and enjoying her time <br>
 &emsp;She is such a nice friend that she kept some food for him as well (´꒳`) <p>
 &emsp;Due to the unbalance between the workload and the pay, they decided to initiate a coup d'état together<br>

 &emsp;At the time, he got mad at her because she started the mission without reaching a consensus first <br>
 &emsp;However, that's just what she does sometimes, she does not share what she had made up in mind until the last minute (or not even does it at all).. <p>
 &emsp;After resolving the team conflict, they thought they got caught by Pa~trick Babe <br>
 &emsp;But thank God - they didn't (❊Hurray❊) <p>
 &emsp;At the end of this long working day, it started raining outside☂ <br>
 <audio src = "https://www.soundjay.com/nature/sounds/rain-06.mp3"></audio> 
 window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", event => {
  const audio = document.querySelector("audio");
  audio.volume = 0.2;
  audio.play();
});
 &emsp;Not only the mission was completed, she managed to sneak out some leftover wine as well <p>
 &emsp;The rain was quite heavy so they sat under the slide and took random sips of the cheap wine <br>
 &emsp;It was such a spine-tingling day <p>
 &emsp;Don't remember what happened after but they probably biked back together to their secret base as raindrops fell all over on them <br>
