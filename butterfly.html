 &emsp;So, after one month of the a bit disastrous confession, they got together •㋔•㋱•㋢•㋣•㋒•<p>
 &emsp;This is a real big deal, you know<br>
 &emsp;But at the same time, it's not that much of a big deal<br>
 &emsp;<img src= "https://media.giphy.com/media/VeB9ieebylsaN5Jw8p/giphy.gif" width="20%"><p>
 &emsp;I guess what I meant is since the relationship kind of changed, a lot of things are now different<br>
 &emsp;But, since they are still good friends with each other so not everything changed<br>
 &emsp;I think this is very nice and appreciate it a lot ☯<p>
 &emsp;Hope you like the little storyline so far & that you are in a happy mood right now <a href="tusindtak.html">囍</a>
