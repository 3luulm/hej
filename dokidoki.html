&emsp;Before starting to read the main body, lets take a look of this <br>
&emsp;A (supposingly) famous structure claimed by a (supposingly) famous critc… <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Gustav_Freytag_by_Karl_Stauffer-Bern_1886-1887.jpg">Gustav Freytag</a> san <p>

&emsp;So this ⇣ is the fucking CLIMAX <p>
&emsp;After carefully confirming her intensions and making the TO-DO plan <br>
&emsp;She decided to tell him how she had been feeling about him on the day of chosen <br>
&emsp;&emsp;'It was a nice day' - She thought <br>
&emsp;&emsp;'They've got yuzu liqueur and bubbles, were both a bit tipsy but yet to be too drunk, had great convos and were ready for dinner' <br>
&emsp;&emsp;'When could be a better timing then now?' - She thought <br>
&emsp;She made a plan and knew she was just going to follow it <br>
&emsp;&emsp;'Just follow it' - She was silently shouting in her mind and it even echoed back <p>
&emsp;☁It would be a very feasible plan if I start with question☁ <br>
&emsp;Unfortunately, she forgot to consider the possibility of him refusing to answer a simple question <p>
&emsp;<span style = "background-color: black"> <font color="white"> E04 error </font></span> <br>
&emsp;<span style = "background-color: black"> <font color="white"> E04 error </font></span> <br>
&emsp;<span style = "background-color: black"> <font color="white"> E04 error </font></span> <br>
&emsp;<br>
&emsp;After clicking [execute] for 100 times, the result was still an error (100th)<br>
&emsp;Not knowing how to react and what to do in the circumstance, she started crashing <p>
&emsp;&emsp;Symptom 1. Not able to talk like normal human being and kept repeating herself <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Symptom 2. Couldn't look at his face and function <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Symptom 3. Refuse to follow the dinner plan <p>
&emsp;The abnormal behavior made it confusing for him to judge what was going on, and he was just repeating - Why are you angry? <p>
&emsp;She did not want to be mistaken as having emotional dysregulation, but at the same time she could not explain <br>
&emsp;She couldn't say it when they left the grass; she couldn't say it when they went to bathroom; she couldn't say it when they were waiting for the metro <br>
&emsp;She finally said it ON the metro p.s. Then she escaped right away <p>
&emsp;Even though she was really nervous af,㊗ I'm so happy and proud that she said it nevertheless <a href="butterfly.html">㊗</a>
