 It all started in a freezing day in Copenhagen, a Japanese boy and a Taiwanese girl were desperate to meet new friends in the new semester…
They sneaked into the movie night full of hope, but the first attempt of making new friends failed as thet encountered a racist Asian American 
After learning that the Japanese dude had met a Taiwaese guy (who loves to send weird stamps via messenger) in the first class, she asked to have a drinking night vigorously
Of course there were some barriers before the goal was met..

	Option 1: the Japanese guy forgot to bring his ID so they could not enter The Old Irish Pub and had to eat Kebab in the cold wind
	Option 2: the Taiwanese guy was new to CPH so he could not find the metro station and head to the right place
	Option 3: All of above

Luckily, the two lonely friends managed to get some alcohol before shops were closed; and the Taiwanese guy also found the right door
Even better, he brought a nice and Jägermeister-addicted friend along!

Even though rosé was called 'tastes like raw fish' and half of the time boys were talking about 'IBD, Big4, MBB' etc., it was an impeccable night
They were playing drinking games while playing Queen's under pressure
That was the beginning of the semester and of 2019 (　◜◡‾) <p>
