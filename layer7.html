&emsp;It all started in a freezing day in Copenhagen, a Japanese boy and a Taiwanese girl were desperate to meet new friends in the new semesterâ€¦ <br>
&emsp;They sneaked into the movie night full of hope, but the first attempt of making new friends failed as thet encountered a racist Asian American <br>
&emsp;After learning that the Japanese dude had met a Taiwaese guy (who loves to send weird stamps via messenger) in the first class, she asked to have a drinking night vigorously <br>

&emsp;Of course there were some barriers before the goal was met.. <p>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Option 1: the Japanese guy forgot to bring his ID so they could not enter The Old Irish Pub and had to eat Kebab in the cold wind <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Option 2: the Taiwanese guy was new to CPH so he could not find the metro station and head to the right place <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Option 3: All of above <p>
&emsp;Luckily, the two lonely friends managed to get some alcohol before shops were closed; and the Taiwanese guy also found the right door <p>
&emsp;Even better, he brought a nice and JÃ¤germeister-addicted friend along!<br>

&emsp;Even though rosÃ© was called 'tastes like raw fish' and half of the time boys were talking about 'IBD, Big4, MBB' etc., it was an impeccable night <br>
&emsp;They were playing drinking games while playing Queen's under pressure <p>
&emsp;That was just the beginning of the semester and of 2019 (ã€€â—œâ—¡â€¾) <p>
