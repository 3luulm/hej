&emsp;After bothering him to buy the flight tickets and concert tickets for countless times (he looked very annoyed at the time but so glad she did not give up on annoying him)<br> 
&emsp;They finally did it so they got to go on a trip together!! <p>
&emsp;<strong>Day 1 was a unplanned day </strong> <p>
&emsp;So, here’s what happened after carefully sorting things together: <p>
&emsp;&emsp;Plan A: They were supposed to meet up in the evening, but the his flight was delayed <br>
&emsp;&emsp;Plan B: Therefore, they ended up seeing each other late at night and their 1st thing to do was to get nuggets at McDonald's (HOW CLASSIC⍢) <p>
&emsp;Something to bring up here, the furnishings of the room were really to the point that they could share the space while remaining some room for each of them <br>
&emsp;Good Job Station Backpacker's Hostel ^^ <p>
&emsp;<strong>Day 2 was an artsy day </strong> <p>
&emsp;Started off from going to the local weekend market then to Unser Ebertplatz <br>
&emsp;Köln is surprisingly a city full of arts (the presumption came from the large percentage of grey on the street) <br>
&emsp;Then, it was the "main activity" that brought them to Köln - <span style = "background-color: blue">  <font color="white"> ONE OK ROCK's concert </font></span>!!! <p>
&emsp;To be honest, the memory of the concert itself is quite vague<br>
&emsp;It's so vague that I couldn’t even recall it while we were sorting the chronological order of this trip <br>
&emsp;Though it was the original purpose, the dominant image of the trip is that it was such a great time for us, and that it was the 1st time we travelled together <p>
&emsp;Anyways, the concert was great and we ended up spending our night in a local karaoke bar until it shut down the music in the unsatisfied scolding <br>
&emsp;He continued the adventure of the night by exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascha_(brothel)">☛</a> (while she was in her sweet dreams) <p>
&emsp;<strong>Day 3 was a day full of everything </strong> <p>
&emsp;I recall it was a sunny day, which they visited so many photography shops already in the morning looking for film <br>
&emsp;The result was disappointing due to overpricing of those little loops <br>
&emsp;However, visiting those shops made them went to some less touristic parts of the city, and they accidently went in to a church and to an exhibition that none of them remembers what it was about <p>
&emsp;She was already tired of walking and hungry so she kept repeating: I want Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte <br>
&emsp;<img src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/1mgmRGlNBfEGAmAS6v/giphy.gif" width = "25%"> <br>
&emsp;Not sure if he also wanted a slice of it, but he was nice and accompanied her to share the treat <p>
&emsp;When they got back to the city center, they encountered a creative artist in front of the cathedral <br>
&emsp;The creative man drew many flags in round shape so that people could throw coins on where they came from <p> 
&emsp;Not seeing a Taiwanese flag, of course we had to show him where we are from and add it to the global community <br>
&emsp;The flag drew by chalk was so vulnerable that a small rain could erase it in a second <br>
&emsp;But seeing the mixture of blue, red and white on the floor is like printing and showing it to everyone <br>
&emsp;It was right in front of the cathedral; everyone must have seen it <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;~This was one of my favorite parts of this journey~ <p>
&emsp;Then, the order started to get uncertain… <br>
&emsp;They went to Museum Ludwig, entered a perfume shop, bought bubble tea, went into the cathedral and met a nice couple in the Hämmche restaurant <br>
&emsp;Everyone seems to be extra nice to them when they are together <p>
&emsp;It was a day required lots of walking <br>
&emsp;But since it was also their last night, they kept wandering around in the city until late night <br>
&emsp;Hohenzollern Bridge was the iconic spot of the walk <p>
&emsp;After that, they were hungry and found the great currywurst stand right next to the central station <p>
&emsp;<strong>Day 4 she woke up and he was already gone </strong> <p>
&emsp;There was no sadness of ending, both of them were excited to begin a new trip with another friend <br>
&emsp;They said goodbye to Köln in excitement and joyfulness <a href="layer4.html">✈</a>
